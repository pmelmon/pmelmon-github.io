##  A quantitative approach to hiring a VPE

Ok, here is a subject I am passionate about, having gone thru the interview process from both sides of the table multiple times.  You have just plunked down between 80 and 120K to do a retained search for your next (or first) VP of Engineering.  What are the 5 questions that you **must** include in the itnerview process ?
## The Questions



1. How many engineers on your current team have worked with you in the past ?
2. How many engineers on your current team have worked with you more than once in the past ?
3. How many engineers have you hired in the past 12 months ? 24 months ?
4. How many engineerings have you fired in the past 12 months ? 24 month ?
5. What do you do for fun outside of work ? (see the HBS study on this: [http://blogs.hbr.org/2009/01/the-interview-question-you-sho/](http://blogs.hbr.org/2009/01/the-interview-question-you-sho/)
